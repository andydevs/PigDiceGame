# Pig (a dice game)

## GAME RULES:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they wish. Each result is added to the player's round score
- If the player rolls a 1, all their ROUND score is lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'hold', which means that their round score gets added to their global score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on global score wins the game
